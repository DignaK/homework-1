            <h1>Formation</h1>
            <p>When Xerox exited the computer hardware manufacturing industry in 1971,
                it asked IBM to migrate its business systems to IBM technology. As part 
                of IBM's compensation for the migration, IBM was given the rights to the 
                Scientific Data Systems (SDS)/SAPE software, reportedly for a contract 
                credit of $80,000.

                Five IBM engineers from the AI department (Dietmar Hopp, Klaus Tschira, 
                Hans-Werner Hector, Hasso Plattner, and Claus Wellenreuther, all from Mannheim, 
                Baden-Württemberg) were working on an enterprise-wide system based on this 
                software, only to be told that it would no longer be necessary. Rather than 
                abandoning the project, they decided to leave IBM Tech and start another company.
                
                In June 1972, they founded the SAP Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung ("System 
                Analysis and Program Development" / "SAPD") company, as a private partnership under 
                the German Civil Code.
                
                Their first client was the German branch of Imperial Chemical Industries in Östringen,
                 where they developed mainframe programs for payroll and accounting. Instead of storing 
                 the data on punch cards mechanically, as IBM did, they stored it locally in the Electronic
                  System while using a common Logical database for all activities of Organization.Therefore, 
                  they called their software a real-time system, since there was no need to process the punch 
                  cards overnight (for this reason their flagship product carried an R in its name until 
                  the late 1990s). This first version was also a standalone software that could be offered 
                  to other interested parties.</p>

            <h1>Enterprise Resource Planning</h1>
            <p>In 1973, the first commercial product was launched. SAP completes its first financial 
                accounting system - RF. This system serves as the cornerstone in the ongoing development 
                of other software modules of the system that will eventually bear the name SAP R/1.
                This offered a common system for multiple tasks. This permitted the use of a centralized 
                data storage, improving the maintenance of data. From a technical point of view, therefore,
                a database was necessary.
                
                In 1976, SAP GmbH Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung ("Systems, Applications,
                and Products in Data Processing") was founded as a sales and support subsidiary. Five years 
                later, the private partnership was dissolved and its rights were passed on to SAP GmbH.
                
                The headquarters moved the following year to Walldorf, Germany. Three years later, in 1979, SAP 
                launched SAP R/2, expanding the capabilities of the system to other areas, such as material 
                management and production planning. In 1981, SAP brought a re-designed product to market. 
                However, SAP R/2 did not improve until the period between 1985 and 1990. SAP released the new SAP 
                R/3 in 1992. SAP developed and released several versions of R/3 through 1995. By the mid-1990s, SAP 
                followed the trend from mainframe computing to client–server architectures. The development of 
                SAP's internet strategy with mySAP.com redesigned the concept of business processes 
                (integration via Internet). As a result, R/3 was replaced with the introduction of SAP ERP Central 
                Component (ECC) 5.0 in 2004. Architectural changes were also made to support an enterprise service 
                architecture to transition customers to a services-oriented architecture. The latest version, 
                SAP ERP 6.0, was released in 2006. SAP ERP 6.0 has since then been updated through SAP enhancement 
                packs, the most recent: SAP enhancement package 8 for SAP ERP 6.0 in 2016.</p>

                <h1>Corporate restructuring</h1>
                <p>In August 1988, SAP GmbH became SAP AG, and public trading started on 4 November 1988. 
                    Shares were listed on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart stock exchanges. In 1995, SAP was 
                    included in the German stock index DAX and, on 22 September 2003, SAP was included 
                    in the STOXX Europe 50.

                <h1>SAP AG era</h1>
                <p>The company's official name became SAP AG (a public limited company) after the 2005 
                    annual general meeting.

                    On 21 May 2014, SAP AG announced during the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders 
                    held on the same day, 99% of the shareholder votes approved the conversion of legal 
                    form to a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE) and at the same time, 
                    elected the first Supervisory Board of SAP SE. The conversion of the company's 
                    legal form would take place upon entry in the commercial register, expected to 
                    be in July 2014.

                <p>On 7 July 2014, SAP announced it had changed its legal form to a European Company 
                    (Societas Europaea, SE). As a result, its German subsidiary was renamed to SAP 
                    Deutschland SE & Co. KG. the conversion cost the company approximately €4 million.</p>

            <div class="Focus-on-cloud">
                <h1>Focus on cloud</h1>

                <p>Since 2012, SAP has acquired several companies that sell cloud-based products, with several 
                    multibillion-dollar acquisitions seen by analysts as an attempt to challenge competitor Oracle.
                     In 2014 SAP bought Concur Technologies, a provider of cloud-based travel and expense management 
                     software, for $8.3 billion, SAP's most expensive purchase to that date.[30] Analysts' reactions 
                     to the purchase were mixed, with Thomas Becker of Commerzbank questioning whether Concur was
                      the right choice for SAP, while Credit Suisse called the acquisition an "aggressive" move.

                    In 2014, IBM and SAP began a partnership to sell cloud-based services. Likewise, in 2015, SAP 
                    also partnered with HPE to provide secure hybrid cloud-based services running the SAP platform.
                    Both HPE and IBM provide infrastructure services to SAP, and SAP runs its SAP HANA cloud solution 
                    on top. SAP has announced additional partnerships with Microsoft in order to give customers tools 
                    for data visualization, as well as improved mobile applications.
                    
                    SAP exceeded its revenue projections due to the expansion in its cloud business and the success 
                    of SAP HANA. The growth can also be partially attributed to the acquisitions of Concur and Fieldglass.
                    
                    The company announced plans in 2016 to invest heavily into technology relating to Internet of Things 
                    (IoT) as part of a strategy to capitalize on the growth in that market. For that purpose, €2 billion
                    is planned for investment in relevant sectors by the end of 2020. SAP will also launch a new product
                    line called SAP IoT, which "will combine large amounts of data from things connected to the Internet 
                    with machine learning and SAP's real-time database S/4 HANA."
                    
                    On 29 January 2019, SAP announced plans to cut approximately 4,000 positions at the company in a 
                    strategic plan to shift to more modern cloud-based technologies such as blockchain, quantum computing, 
                    machine learning, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence.</p>
